# In this project I used a ready-made dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/abedkhooli/arabic-100k-reviews) containing:
# Over 100,000 reviews collected from hotels, books, movies, products, and a few airlines. 
# Consists of three categories (Mixed, Negative and Positive). You have removed thecategory "Mixed".
# Then I extracted the features and made 3 word clouds, and finally I applied the logistic regression algorithm using TF-IDF and Bag of Word model
